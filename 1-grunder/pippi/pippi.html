    <p>The Geneva Conventions comprise four treaties, and three additional protocols, that establish the standards of
        international law for humanitarian treatment in war.
    <p>The singular term Geneva Convention usually denotes the agreements of 1949, negotiated in the aftermath of the
        Second World War (1939–1945), which updated the terms of the two 1929 treaties, and added two new conventions.

    <h2>Historia</h2>
    <p>The Geneva Conventions extensively defined the basic rights of wartime prisoners (civilians and military
        personnel), established protections for the wounded and sick, and established protections for the civilians in
        and around a war-zone. The treaties of 1949 were ratified, in whole or with reservations, by 196 countries.[1]
        Moreover, the Geneva Convention also defines the rights and protections afforded to non-combatants.</p>

    <h2>Persongalleri</h2>
    <p>The Swiss businessman Henry Dunant went to visit wounded soldiers after the Battle of Solferino in 1859. He was
        shocked by the lack of facilities, personnel, and medical aid available to help these soldiers. As a result, he
        published his book, A Memory of Solferino, in 1862, on the horrors of war.[2] His wartime experiences inspired
        Dunant to propose:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A permanent relief agency for humanitarian aid in times of war</li>
        <li>A government treaty recognizing the neutrality of the agency and allowing it to provide aid in a war zone
        </li>
    </ul>
