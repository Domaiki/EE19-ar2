    <h1>Weatherday - Porcelain Hands</h1>
    <img src="./bilder/weatherday.jpeg" alt="comein" class="center">
    <p>Porcelain hands<br>
        Feel around<br>
        I can't see you here<br>
        "Just come in"<br></p>

    <p>Porcelain hands<br>
        It's so dark<br>
        I feel far from here<br>
        "Are you sure?"<br></p>
    <p>How the free fall feeling<br>
        From back home followed me here<br>
        Shouldn't be this clouded<br>
        Not that anything is clear<br>
        Somewhere out there I imagine<br>
        Her in my own sense<br>
        Dressed in porcelain fashion<br>
        And like me she's acting tense<br></p>
    <p>Porcelain hands<br>
        Are you there<br>
        Was this real<br>
        Look around<br>
        No one's there<br>
        "Go to sleep"<br>
        When awake<br>
        I'm not me<br>
        If I'd fall<br>
        Down the stairs<br>
        And haunt a shell<br>
        That looks like me<br></p>
    <p>(I undress every day<br>
        As the shape I was born<br>
        So today just for once<br>
        I'll wear clothes under clothes)<br>
        Porcelain hands<br>
        You can't fall<br>
        Down the stairs<br>
        To see yourself<br>
        (Painted face by painted nails<br>
        After all this waiting<br>
        I'm not some embarrassing painting)<br></p>
        <p>Anyway I would do anything for you<br>
        If it meant I'd get a small hint of warmth<br>
        Even when it truly felt like rooms got smaller<br>
        I would fight to stick around just in case you'd come in<br>
        You would come and knock three times on my door<br>
        I would tell you to come in and to stay<br>
        All I wanted was to be a part of your life<br>
        You're invited so come in</p>
